# Jonathan Hsieh's Theater Log

All of my theater stuff

## Shrek Jr. (2016)

#### Role: Dwarf (Lord Farquad's father/"Daddy?")

Originally set to play both the dwarf and a woodland animal but I hated the animal costume, so I just pretended that I was only a dwarf. Ms. Improta (apparently) didn’t notice.

#### What it Was: Summer camp musical

Whitney’s drama camp program for 2016. Was entering 4th grade and happened to be in town for the summer (I lived in NorCal at the time) so took part in the camp. Met THE Darshan Powers (Pinnochio) and had a hell of a time terrorizing the dressing room together.

#### Overall Experience: Fun AF (10/10)

Got a dermatitis attack for most of the production time (which for a 9 year old would occupy 99% of my mind) but Darshan and Subway Surfers (It was THE S*** back then…) saved the day.

#### For 4 years afterward I toiled, trying to find a meaning to my life. Then I stumbled upon the pilot…

## Douglass Middle School Theater Class, Zoom Edition (2020 - 2021)

#### Role: Various smart and stupid people

Played a nerd stuck in a elevator (Trapped), King Macbeth (Macbeth, Incredibly Abridged), and a Telemundo reporter from Mexico (despite being the only non-Mexican kid in my class).

#### What it Was: Douglass Middle School’s pilot theater class

First theater class the school had ever done. Unfortunately it was smack in the middle of the pandemic, so we had to to theater over Zoom. Instead of performing scenes with each other, we had to record clips of us acting and edit them together (where I got my affinity for video editing).

#### Overall Experience: Fun but would’ve been better in person (8.5/10)

If it weren’t over Zoom, it most certainly would’ve been a 10/10 for reintroducing me to my current form of escapism.

#### Then I moved to SoCal, got (reluctantly) into Whitney and joined…

## Whitney High School Theater 1 Class (2021 - 2022)

#### Role: Various smart an stupid people (again)

Played a kid too smart for everyone else, a gentleman approached by a tramp who works as a drowning reenactor, Jekyll & Hyde, and the Marquise de Lafayette.

#### What it Was: Whitney High School’s Theater 1 class

This was Ms. Improta’s (the younger one) first year as a teacher here, and I can say that I probably made it too memorable.

#### Overall Experience: Fun AF (10/10)

This class was the highlight of my day and made my grueling schedule worth it. Made friends in people from all the high school grades including Miranda, Andrew, Glory, Lorenzo, and Aditya.

#### Some of the bigger things I did during this class include the following…

## The Toys Take Over Christmas (2021)

#### Role: The Toymaker (Bosh and nonsense!)

I refuse to speak of this ever again.

#### What it Was: An after-school performance for little children

We did a free show for little kids. Lorenzo played an uncharacteristically slim Santa Claus.

#### Overall Experience: I refuse to speak of this ever again (1/10).

It was fun, it’s just my role made for my most stupid, tantrum throwing, and memorable (probably the worst aspect) performance yet.

#### The other big thing, which isn’t as big since it was an assignment, was…

## Yellow, Red, Blue (2022)

#### Role: Engel (The colorful one)

I play the colorful and emotional counterpart of Hans, a painter who only uses the color black and is completely emotionless.

#### What it Was: An original scene written by Greta Chang and I.

We were supposed to select a painting, and then write a scene based off of it. Greta and I chose Gelb, Rot, Blau (Yellow, Red, Blue) by Wassily Kandinsky

[Our script.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6J4OiD2z64Hh9T2vhiHyb6Kc8MJzBzJJ2PPWdsr58o/)

#### Overall Experience: Fun, but turned out depressingly dark (9.5/10)

It was fun to perform and design. After re-reading the script almost a year later, I realize that Greta and I were seriously in need of psychiatric attention…

#### And now here’s where it gets fun…

## In the Heights (2022)

#### Role: CREW!!! (Props, specifically)

Crew is better than cast. I stand by this statement with my soul chained to the crew god.

#### What it Was: ABC district musical (2022)

I auditioned, but didn’t really do that well. So I joined the crew instead.

#### Overall Experience: Fun AF (10/10)

Working crew is especially fun when you see the cast suffer at the hands of their own wrongdoing (This show ran into a lot of problems, notably it being pushed back a month…).
 
## Little Shop of Horrors (2022)

#### Role: CREW!!! (Props again!)

Crew is still better than cast (especially for this one with Angad Jumpscare Batra in the lead role).

#### What it Was: Whitney High School spring musical (2022)

Ms. Improta said that casting Angad as the lead was the most risky decision she’s ever made in her life. He turned out to be perfect for the role.

#### Overall Experience: Fun AF (10/10)

I got to watch Angad piggyback Mino; what more could I ask for? I also ended up being the only boy on the crew, which was a tad bit scary…

## Aladdin Jr. (2022)

#### Role: Prince Abdullah AND CREW!!! (It’s complicated)

The summer camps are divided into two different shows. There’s an AM (morning) camp and a PM (afternoon) one. I played the role of Prince Abdullah in the PM show but worked props crew for the first AM show and lavs crew (the most stressful crew) for the second one.

#### What it Was: Summer camp musical

After a 6 year absence from Whitney’s summer camp program, I made a less than triumphant return as a misogynistic Arabian prince… lovely.

#### Overall Experience: Fun AF (10/10)

It was an incredibly stressful journey (especially since I missed the first week on a trip), but it was worth pouring my heart and soul into a show almost no one saw.

## Clue (2022)

#### Role: Mr. Boddy

I basically played dead for an hour and a half after a short appearance as the blackmailer before it’s revealed after my death that I’m the actual butler.

#### What it Was: Whitney High School fall play (2022)

I had blast during rehearsal despite sitting down and having my butt falling asleep for hours.

#### Overall Experience: (Fun AF) (12/10)

12 is above FUN AF. And I mean it when I say it was my favorite life experience so far.

## Shrek Jr. (2022)

#### Role: CREW!!! (Props Head)

Well, things certainly have come full circle, haven’t they? It is an honor to work crew for the same production that first started my theater journey 6 years ago.

#### What it Is: Whitney High School middle school district musical

I’m too old to perform, so I took the better option of working crew! (Crew > Cast).

#### Overall Experience: (Fun But Tiring AF) (9.9/10)

These little middle schoolers drove me insane.

## (Upcoming) You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown (2022)

#### Role: Schroeder

I get to play the toy piano

#### What it Is: An after-school performance for little children
We did this before in the form of a production I refuse to speak of ever again.

#### Overall Experience: Pending.

## (Upcoming) The Addams Family (2023)

#### Role: Ensemble (Ancestor)

At auditions I did bad at singing, okay at acting (my strong suit…), and then proceeded to surprise myself with a sudden decency at dancing, so I somehow managed to get a part…

#### What it Is: ABC district musical (2023)

I’m am very, very excited for this (Addams Family fan here).
I also designed the auditions poster:

#### Overall Experience: Pending.
